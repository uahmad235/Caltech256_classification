# Caltech256_classification

The notebook applies multiple Pytorch-based classification models on [Caltech256 dataset](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/generated/torchvision.datasets.Caltech256.html).

## Requirements:
* The notebook requires only one dependnecy: `pytorch`

## Models Architectures:
1) Baseline model with Custom CNN architecture

2) Use VGG16 for transfer learning 


* Model train/val/test loss & f1-score are being logged on tensorboard for easier comparison.
